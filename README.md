## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. 🔍 Penetration Testing Challenge – SSL Vulnerability Scan
**Tools:** Kali Linux, Nikto  
**Objective:** Perform a penetration test on an SSL-enabled website.  
**Highlights:**
- Scanned `fantasy.premierleague.com` to identify missing security headers.
- Discovered missing `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`, exposing the site to clickjacking and MIME-sniffing attacks.
- Analyzed HTTP response headers and documented vulnerabilities with actionable recommendations.

### 2. 🔐 Server Security Lab – Pre & Post SSL Hardening
**Tools:** Kali Linux, Nikto  
**Objective:** Set up a basic website, enforce SSL, and evaluate security improvements.  
**Highlights:**
- Identified issues such as missing `Strict-Transport-Security` and improper content encoding.
- Compared vulnerability reports before and after SSL enforcement.
- Provided detailed analysis and mitigation strategies based on scan output.
